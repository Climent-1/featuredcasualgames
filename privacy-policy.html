    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 10, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all games and applications (collectively, the "Games") developed and published by <strong>Featured Casual Games</strong> (referred to herein as "we," "us," or "our").</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We do not directly collect, store, or use any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. However, we use third-party Service Providers and Advertising Networks to analyze Game performance, track marketing campaigns, and serve ads.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

    <p>We do not directly collect any <strong>Personal Data</strong> from you while you use our Games. "Personal Data" includes information such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, or precise geographic location.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Analytics and Attribution Service Providers</h2>

    <p>We use third-party service providers to help us analyze how users interact with our Games (analytics) and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns (attribution). These providers collect and process non-personal data on our behalf.</p>

    <p>The following Service Providers are integrated into our Games:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Service Provider</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Information Collected (Non-Personal)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Google Firebase</strong></td>
                <td>Analytics, crash reporting, and usage monitoring.</td>
                <td>Device and Usage information (e.g., Device ID, IP address, operating system, time spent in game, in-game events).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>AppsFlyer</strong></td>
                <td>Mobile attribution and marketing analytics (tracking where users came from).</td>
                <td>Device Identifiers (IDFA, Android Advertising ID), IP address, device type, and installation details.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Advertising Networks</h2>

    <p>Our Games are supported by advertising. To provide these advertisements, we integrate with third-party advertising partners who may collect certain data for the purpose of serving relevant ads and analyzing ad performance. This collection is governed by the privacy policies of the respective third parties.</p>

    <p><strong>The following third-party advertising networks are integrated into our Games:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>AppLovin</li>
        <li>Google (AdMob/AdSense)</li>
        <li>Meta (Facebook Audience Network)</li>
        <li>DT Exchange</li>
        <li>IronSource</li>
        <li>Mintegral</li>
        <li>Pangle</li>
        <li>Unity Ads</li>
        <li>Liftoff</li>
        <li>Inmobi</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.1. Information Collected by Third Parties</h3>

    <p>These third-party advertising networks may automatically collect and use certain non-personal data for the purpose of personalized and non-personalized advertising. This data may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Such as device type, device ID (e.g., IDFA, Android Advertising ID).</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Operating system, language, time zone, network status.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address</strong> (used to infer general location, like country or city).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about your interactions with the ads and the Game.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>We do not control the practices of these third parties.</strong> We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these providers to understand their data collection practices and your options regarding their use of your information.</p>


    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our Games are casual and generally suitable for all ages. However, we do not specifically target children under the age of 13.</p>

    <p>Since we do not directly collect any Personal Data, we comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) by utilizing available tools (such as those provided by the app stores and our service/ad partners) to ensure that the ad networks and service providers treat users identified as being under 13 in a manner compliant with applicable laws. This often means serving only non-personalized ads and limiting data collection for these users.</p>

    <h2>5. International Data Transfers</h2>

    <p>As our Games are published globally, the data collected by the third-party service providers and ad networks may be stored and processed in any country where the networks have facilities. By using the Games, you understand that your non-personal data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
